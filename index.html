      <p>Not Wilford Brimley.

        I was a federal agent in the ATF. Our team was breaking up an illegal cockfighting ring in Israel (New Mexico). Brimley was already in the room when we breached the door, stroking his prized cock. Suddenly, he bellowed like an seasonally engorged walrus, expertly mainlined 400cc of insulin like Bane Beetus itself, and assumed a sumo stance. He then drove a 260 pound agent -- a former college linebacker -- through a concrete pillar. Broke that man's spine and ended his career forever. That man was my friend. I'll never forget the sound. I then screamed "CALL LIBERTY!" to whomever would hear, because we needed backup badly. In less than a second, Brimley yanked an ancient-looking double barreled 12-gauge shotgun, and a fucking MONSTER sword, like a 2-handed flamberge from a fanny pack we hadn't even eyed before. Now he's soaking up .45 APC rounds like they're f**king glucotabs. We're trying to fight to a retreat and he starts bellowing in Sumerian, and the weather suddenly gets really vicious, as in driving, chill rain and sharp lightning. It was almost pitch black out as I scrambled back to the tactical vehicle. There's an incredible flash of lightning and the last thing I saw before the artillery struck was Brimley whirling like a dervish and hollering, carving his delicate way through my team like an insulin needle through an army of moist, flabby arms. No human could have survived that flurry, and yet here he was at the foot of my hospital bed at three in the morning just as the blackout hit: first the main power, and then the generator. The only light was the glow of his huge cigar. He appeared not vaguely demonic. I was in traction, literally and figuratively. He slowly ground his cigar out on his own forehead. The light died then and stayed dead for what seemed like forever. When the power clicked back on, there on my lap was a writ of pardon for Mr. Brimley from the governor, as well as a summons. Brimley was suing the agency. The cockfighting was a religious ritual, sacred to Odinists. Ignore orders and stay away from this man, his followers, and his priestesses at all costs. He is above the law, and beyond time. He is a Highlander with no neck. He cannot be killed, and neither can I.</p>
