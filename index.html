        <p>
          With a Bachelor's in Computer Science, a Graduate Certificate in
          Cybersecurity, and a Master's of Science in Cybersecurity, I command a
          breadth of knowledge across the vast disciplines of computer science.
          My expertise spans programming, system maintenance, technical support,
          and the nuanced realms of applied theory, including emerging fields
          like post-quantum encryption. A current CompTIA A+ certification
          attests to my mastery of IT operations and the art of technical
          support. Beyond the technical, I am equally adept in written and
          verbal communication, earning the enduring trust and praise of clients
          for my clarity and precision. Renowned for an intuitive knack for
          problem-solving, an unrelenting drive to learn, and a rare
          adaptability, I thrive on untangling complexity.
